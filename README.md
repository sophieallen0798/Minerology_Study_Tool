# My Personal Project:
## Mineralogy ID Tool

The application will allow users to practice identifying minerals based on their physical 
properties. 

As a user, I want to be able to practice identifying and recognizing minerals using their
properties.

When the user starts the game, they will be given a property of a random, unknown mineral. They
will be given the option to either guess the name of the mineral, or reveal another property
of the unidentified mineral. If all the properties of the unidentified mineral have been
revealed, they have to guess the name of the mineral. If the user guesses the name of the 
mineral incorrectly, the game will end, and the number of minerals they correctly identified 
will be recorded as their score. Their scores and the list of the minerals they identified to
receive that score will be recorded so that they know what areas they need to work on studying.

**The properties each mineral will have associated with it are**
  - lustre (String)
  - hardness (int range)
  - crystal system (String, 6 categories)
  - cleavage (number of planes, angles)
  - habit (String)
  - streak (String)
